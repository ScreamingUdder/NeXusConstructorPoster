One facility that conducts spallation experiments is the ISIS Pulsed Muon and Neutron source located in Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. It is a world leader in terms of its scientific output and has some number of visitors every year. A similar facility, the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden, is presently under construction. Once completed, the ESS will be the most powerful spallation source in the world. The science due to take place at the ESS will be fundamentally similar to that of ISIS, so it is anticipated that these facilities will have similar software needs. As such, the decision was made to have the ESS use much of the software that is presently used at ISIS.

The instruments used to conduct spallation experiments are comprised of various different components that are used to alter the beam of neutrons and/or to measure/detect certain phenomena. Such components include neutron detectors, which capture the pulse of energy after going through a target, and disk choppers, which interrupt the beam so that only neutrons of a certain speed may reach the material that we wish to study. Precise knowledge of the properties and whereabouts of these components is vital in order to analyse the results of our experiments reliably.
