One facility that conducts spallation experiments is the ISIS Pulsed Muon and Neutron source located in Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. A similar facility, the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden, is presently under construction. The science due to take place at the ESS will be fundamentally similar to that of ISIS, so it is anticipated that these facilities will have similar software needs. As such, the decision was made to have the ESS use much of the software that is presently used at ISIS.
