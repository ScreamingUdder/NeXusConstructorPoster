The NeXus file format arose out of a desire to describe the configurations of neutron experiments in a way that is ``facility-neutral." An advantage is that this allows for greater openness in scientific research. However, the format is not particularly easy to work with for the unitiated and scientists would much rather get their data and get on with their day. The NeXus Constructor, a tool being developed by software developers based at ISIS Pulsed Muon and Neutron Source in the UK and the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden, attempts to solve this problem by providing an interface for users to easily examine and modify the contents of NeXus files.
