Accelerator experiments would be pointless without data analysis and visualisation. In order to perform accurate data analysis, you need to lay out where each component is with high precision, such as neutron detectors, which capture the pulse of energy after going through a sample, or disk choppers, which cut the beam of neutrons up.
