Neutron sources direct neutron beams at materials in order to obeserve their behaviour on the atomic scale. The instruments used to conduct these experiments are comprised of various different components that can be used to alter the beam or measure/detect certain phenomena. Such components include neutron detectors, which capture the pulse of energy after going through a targer, and disk choppers, which interupt the beam so that only neutrons of a certain speed may reach a target. Precise knowledge of where these components are place during an experiment is vital in order to analyse the output data reliably. 

The ISIS Pulsed Muon and Neutron source is one such facility and is a world-leader in terms of its scientific output.
