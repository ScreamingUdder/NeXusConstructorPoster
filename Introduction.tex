Accelerator experiments would be pointless without data analysis and visualisation. In order to perform accurate data analysis, you need to lay out where each component is with high precision. These components include neutron detectors, which capture the pulse of energy after going through a targer, and disk choppers, which interupt the beam in order to prevent neutrons of a certain speed from reaching the target.
