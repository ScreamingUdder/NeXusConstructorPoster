The NeXus file format arose out of a desire to describe the configurations of neutron experiments in a way that is ``facility-neutral." An advantage is that this allows for greater openness in scientific research. However, the format is not particularly easy to understand for the unitiated and scientists would much rather get their data and get on with their day. The NeXus Constructor is a tool that attempts to solve this problem by enabling researchers to easily examine and modify the contents of NeXus files.
