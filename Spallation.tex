\textit{Neutron experiments} entail observing how neutrons scatter upon colliding with a sample material of our choosing. The way in which the neutrons scatter tells us something about the material that caused them to scatter. This area of science has a number of significant applications ranging from analysing the composition of historical weapons to identifying defects in plane parts.

The facilities that carry out neutron experiments house a mosaic different components that are used to alter the beam of neutrons in some way and/or to measure/detect certain phenomena. These components include neutron detectors, which capture the pulse of energy after going through a sample, and disk choppers, which periodically interrupt the beam so that only neutrons of a certain speed can get through. As researchers have different things that they wish to study, these components will not all be used in every experiment and will not all be used in the same way. The sum of the components used during an experiment, their properties, their position, etc amounts to what we call the \textit{experiment configuration}. A precise description of this configuration is vital in order to analyse our results reliably, hence the need for a file format that is appropriate for capturing all of this information.
