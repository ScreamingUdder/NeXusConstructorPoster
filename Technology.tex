\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{pint} - Unit conversion. This comes in handy when drawing 3D objects from mesh files or NeXus files that contain geometry information but lack unit information. Pint can help enable validation and conversion for different types of units, as well as different types of different types of units (e.g. ``meter" and ``metres").
\item \texttt{h5py} - Reading from and writing to NeXus files.
\item \texttt{silx} - Displaying the contents of NeXus files in a tree view.
\end{itemize}
\mysubtitle{Development-Related}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{black} and \texttt{flake 8} - Code formatting and linting.
\item \texttt{pre-commit} - Code hygiene.
\item \texttt{pytest} and \texttt{pytest-cov} - Testing with coverage output.
\item \texttt{pytest-qt} - Simulating user interactions in order to check that the user clicking on object X triggers event Y. Especially useful when combined with \texttt{parameterize} to ensure that every \textit{possible} combination of actions that should lead to Y does indeed lead to Y.
