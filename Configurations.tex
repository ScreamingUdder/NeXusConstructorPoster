The facilities that carry out neutron experiments house a mosaic different components that are used to alter the beam of neutrons in some way and/or to measure/detect certain phenomena. As researchers have different things that they wish to study, these components will not all be used in every experiment and will not all be used in the same way. The sum of the components used during an experiment, their properties, their position, etc amounts to what we call the \textit{experiment configuration}. A precise description of this configuration is vital in order to analyse our results reliably, hence the need for a file format that is appropriate for capturing all of this information.
