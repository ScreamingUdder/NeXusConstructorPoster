Neutron experiments involve directing an intense neutron beam at a material we wish to study and then examining the \textit{neutron scattering} that occurs as a result of the neutrons colliding with the atoms in the material. This area of science has a wide variety of applications spanning physics, chemistry, biology, engineering and archaeology.

At the ISIS Pulsed Muon and Neutron Source we carry out around 500 of these experiments every year. A similar facility, the European Spallation Source, is presently under construction and will be able to generate {\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}100 times the neutron flux once it has been completed. These facilities comprise a neutron source which feeds tens of separate \textit{instruments} with neutrons which are then used to carry out different experiments in parallel. The neutron instruments are themselves made up of various \textit{instrument components} that manipulate the neutron beam, maintain the sample being studied in particular conditions, and detect the neutrons.
